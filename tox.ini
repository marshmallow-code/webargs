# for 'mindeps', pin flask to 1.1.3 and markupsafe to 1.1.1
# because flask 1.x does not set upper bounds on the versions of its dependencies
# generally, we can't install just any version from 1.x -- only 1.1.3 and 1.1.4
# markupsafe is a second-order dependency of flask (flask -> jinja2 -> markupsafe)
# and must be pinned explicitly because jinja2 does not pin its dependencies in any
# versions in its 2.x line
# see:
#   https://github.com/marshmallow-code/webargs/pull/694
#   https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4047
